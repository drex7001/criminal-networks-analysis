arguments) and §7 (traversal projection) rewritten 2026-07-18 by T17b under
ADR-029 (mention anchors + identity-revision resolution) and ADR-030 (honest
aggregation); §3.2 (review queue) rewritten 2026-07-18 by T17c under ADR-031

the ADRs win.** · **§1 seams, §2, §3, §3.2 and §8 are implemented by migration
`0007_identity_ledger.py` (T17). §7 is still the Phase-1 view — T21 replaces
it.** · Constitutional basis: Articles I, III, IV, V, VIII, X, XIII

DDL below is illustrative Postgres 16; Alembic migrations are authoritative. IDs are
ULIDs with type prefixes (`ent_`, `clm_`, `src_`, `rec_`, `evd_`, `cas_`) — sortable,
non-guessable enough, grep-friendly.

## 1. Sources and source records

```sql
CREATE TABLE source (
  source_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  source_type      TEXT NOT NULL,      -- ontology: open_source | court_record | human |
                                       -- government_system | sensor | algorithmic | ...
  name             TEXT NOT NULL,
  url              TEXT,
  reliability_scheme     TEXT,         -- e.g. 'admiralty', 'internal-v1'
  reliability_original   TEXT,         -- as graded, e.g. 'B'
  reliability_normalized TEXT,         -- ontology grading.reliability.normalized
  notes            TEXT,
  created_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- one immutable received artifact: a PDF, a transcript, an arrest list, a pasted text,
-- one LLM extraction run's input snapshot
CREATE TABLE source_record (
  record_id      TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  source_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES source,
  ingest_key     TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE, -- sha256(source_system|source_record_id|version) — idempotency (GOAL.md §9.3)
  content_hash   TEXT NOT NULL,        -- sha256 of raw payload in the vault
  storage_uri    TEXT NOT NULL,        -- evidence-vault object (ADR-007)
  media_type     TEXT,
  source_time    TIMESTAMPTZ,          -- when the source produced it, if known
  received_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  handling_code  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'open',
  status         TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'landed',  -- landed | quarantined | processed
  quarantine_reason TEXT,
  provenance     JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',     -- connector, versions, operator, envelope

  -- governance seams (B-08). Nullable in P2, stored and displayed but NOT enforced;
  -- P7 enforces them. They land now so P7 needs no reclassification migration.
  collection_policy_ref TEXT,          -- the policy this was collected under
  retention_class       TEXT,          -- disposition schedule; governed deletion is P7
  authority_ref         TEXT,          -- legal authority object (P7 makes it a real FK)
  authority_valid_from  TIMESTAMPTZ,
  authority_valid_to    TIMESTAMPTZ,
  CHECK (authority_valid_to IS NULL OR authority_valid_from IS NULL
         OR authority_valid_to >= authority_valid_from)
);
```

The current provenance headers written by `legacy/pipeline/ingest.py` move into
`provenance`; raw bytes move into the vault.

**On the seams (B-08).** These five columns are deliberately inert in P2. No
route filters on them, no read path consults them, and nothing may claim they
provide retention or legal-authority governance — that enforcement is P7 work
(specs/03 §6, roadmap P7). They exist now only because retrofitting a
classification column onto a populated evidence corpus is far more expensive
than carrying nullable columns from the start.

## 2. Entities and identity — the decision ledger (ADR-028)

Rewritten by P2 T17a. Semantics, stages, thresholds, migration and the reversal
test plan live in specs/05; this section owns the schema. The Phase-1 shape
(`mention` + timestamp-versioned `identity_membership`, migration `0005`) is the
migration substrate — §2.6 of specs/05 describes the upgrade.

```sql
CREATE TABLE entity (
  entity_id    TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  entity_type  TEXT NOT NULL,          -- ontology object type
  label        TEXT NOT NULL,          -- display only; rebuilt from name claims
  created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  tombstoned_at TIMESTAMPTZ            -- no active memberships, no lineage target;
                                       -- retained forever, ids never reused (specs/05 §5)
);

-- a name-as-written inside one source record. Offsets and script are the H-06
-- minimum: without them a mention cannot be re-anchored to its text.
CREATE TABLE mention (
  mention_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  record_id    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES source_record,
  raw_text     TEXT NOT NULL,
  norm_key     TEXT NOT NULL,          -- slugify() lives on here — a *mention key*, not identity
  char_start   INTEGER,                -- offsets into the derivative text, when known
  char_end     INTEGER,
  script       TEXT,                   -- ISO 15924 when detected: Sinh | Taml | Latn
  language     TEXT,                   -- BCP-47 when detected
  context      TEXT,
  CHECK (char_end IS NULL OR char_start IS NULL OR char_end >= char_start)
);

-- the revision chain. Append-only; revision 0 is the migration baseline.
CREATE TABLE identity_revision (
  revision_id  BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  -- monotonic; ordering is the chain
  decision_id  TEXT REFERENCES identity_decision,  -- NULL only for revision 0
  created_at   TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- one row per human adjudication (Article VII: decided_by is always a person)
CREATE TABLE identity_decision (
  decision_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  kind          TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('confirm','reject','merge','split','unresolved')),
  decided_by    TEXT NOT NULL,          -- human actor; never 'rule:<name>' (ADR-027)
  decision_note TEXT NOT NULL,          -- evidence for the decision — required, always
  candidate_id  TEXT REFERENCES er_candidate,     -- the machine input, when there was one
  input_mentions TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',    -- explicit mention set (splits, manual merges)
  parent_revision_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES identity_revision,  -- optimistic concurrency
  result_revision_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES identity_revision,  -- exactly one per decision
  decided_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE (result_revision_id)
);

-- revision-keyed, reversible identity (Article V). A membership names the revision
-- that opened it and the revision that closed it; history is never deleted.
CREATE TABLE identity_membership (
  membership_id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  mention_id        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES mention,
  entity_id         TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES entity,
  opened_revision_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES identity_revision,
  closed_revision_id BIGINT REFERENCES identity_revision   -- NULL = active
);

-- THE invariant (ADR-028 §2): at most one active membership per mention.
-- Enforced by the database, not by application code.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ux_membership_one_active
  ON identity_membership (mention_id) WHERE closed_revision_id IS NULL;

-- every candidate pair the machine ever produced, with its explanation
CREATE TABLE er_candidate (
  candidate_id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  mention_a        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES mention,
  mention_b        TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES mention,
  producer         TEXT NOT NULL,       -- 'rule:nic' | 'rule:same-norm-key-in-doc' | 'splink'
  producer_version TEXT NOT NULL,       -- settings version (aegis/er/settings.py), git-tracked
  graph_snapshot_id TEXT,               -- projection snapshot used for context features (H-07)
  score            NUMERIC,             -- match probability; NULL for rule producers
  features         JSONB NOT NULL,      -- per-feature waterfall, verbatim (GOAL.md §10.4)
  pre_verified     BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,  -- rule band: batch-confirmable in one action
  disposition      TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'open'
                   CHECK (disposition IN ('open','confirmed','rejected','unresolved','superseded')),
  decision_id      TEXT REFERENCES identity_decision,  -- set when adjudicated
  created_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CHECK (mention_a < mention_b)         -- canonical pair ordering — one row per pair
);

-- a reject is durable: the pair is not re-suggested while the constraint holds
CREATE TABLE identity_negative_constraint (
  constraint_id  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  mention_a      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES mention,
  mention_b      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES mention,
  version        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,   -- superseded by new evidence *type*, never erased
  decision_id    TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES identity_decision,
  evidence_basis TEXT NOT NULL,         -- what was known when it was written (specs/05 §3.3)
  superseded_by  TEXT REFERENCES identity_negative_constraint,
  created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CHECK (mention_a < mention_b)
);

-- rebuildable projection of merge lineage (Article XIII) — losing it loses nothing
CREATE TABLE entity_canonical_map (
  entity_id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES entity,
  canonical_entity_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES entity,
  at_revision_id      BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES identity_revision
);
```

`identity_revision` and `identity_decision` reference each other, so the
migration creates both tables first and adds `identity_revision.decision_id` as
a deferred constraint afterwards. Revision 0 carries `decision_id IS NULL` — it
is a baseline, not a decision anyone made.

Merge lineage is **ledger metadata** — reconstructed from `identity_decision` and
the membership rows it closed and opened. There is no `merged_into` claim: a
claim requires a source record (Article I), and administrative metadata has
none. The `merged_into` predicate is retired from the ontology by the T17
migration.

## 3. Claims

```sql
CREATE TABLE claim (
  claim_id     TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  subject_id   TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES entity,
  predicate    TEXT NOT NULL,           -- ontology predicate — app-validated (ADR-013), never a DB CHECK

  CHECK (subject_id <> object_id)       -- no self-claims (ports the prototype rule)
);

CREATE TABLE claim_relation (
  from_claim TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES claim,
  to_claim   TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES claim,
  relation   TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (relation IN ('corroborates','contradicts')),
  created_by TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (from_claim, to_claim, relation)
);
```

### 3.1 Argument attribution rules (ADR-029)

The hybrid argument model: a claim keeps its **entity** arguments *and* carries
the **mention** evidence behind them. Mention-only references were rejected —
analyst-authored and assessment claims legitimately have no textual mention.

1. **Anchors required by assertion type.** `assertion_type IN ('observed',
   'reported')` — and every claim produced by an extraction producer — must
   carry an anchor for each entity-valued argument. `inferred` and `assessed`
   claims may be unanchored. Enforced in the actions layer at write time, where
   `assertion_type` is already validated (ADR-013), not by a CHECK.
2. **Revision stamp.** Every claim stamps `identity_revision_id` = the active
   revision at `recorded_at`. This records *what identity meant when the claim
   was made*; it is not a resolution instruction.
3. **Resolution.** Projections and queries resolve `subject_id`/`object_id`
   through the **active** revision: via the argument's mention anchor where it
   has one, and via `entity_canonical_map` otherwise (specs/05 §5, §7 above).
   An as-of query may pin an explicit revision instead — that pinning is what
   makes the P4 as-of answer defensible (B-11).
4. **Split behavior.** When a split affects a claim's entity:
   - **Anchored** claims follow their mention. The mention moved to a specific
     entity, so the claim's attribution is decided — no human is asked, and no
     claim row is rewritten.
   - **Unanchored** claims route to **re-adjudication**: a **`claim_draft`**
     entry in the review inbox proposing a replacement claim on the other
     candidate entity, carrying `supersedes` = the original. They are never
     silently reassigned to either side, and never dropped (Article VIII).

     *(T20 correction: this rule originally said a `claim_relation` entry. That
     kind's target action is `link_claims`, which records corroborates /
     contradicts — it cannot express "this claim belongs to the other entity".
     A `claim_draft` can, it keeps the closed kind list at three (ADR-031 §1),
     and it satisfies rule 5 below by construction: the original row is never
     touched, and a human decides whether a superseding claim should exist.)*

     **"A claim's entity" means either argument, resolved.** T20 implemented
     this rule as a subject-side scan for the split entity's literal id, which
     silently found nothing in the two cases that matter most, both caught by
     the T21 projection tests. A claim naming the split entity as its *object*
     was never surfaced — and since symmetric predicates are order-normalized
     at write time, that is roughly half of them. A claim written *before* a
     merge names the **absorbed** id, not the survivor now being split, so
     matching the survivor's id alone missed precisely the merge-then-split
     case the rule exists for. The scan therefore covers both argument
     positions and every id that currently resolves to the split entity, and
     the queued draft repoints whichever end actually named it.
5. **No claim row is ever rewritten by an identity decision.** Merges and
   splits change memberships and the canonical map; `claim.subject_id` and
   `claim.object_id` are immutable after write. This is the property the
   reversal tests assert (specs/05 §8).

**Where mentions come from (T17 refinement).** Extraction *persists* mentions,
before any adjudication: a mention records what the text says, so it is
evidence, not canon — and ER cannot propose merges over extracted names if the
names only exist once a claim is accepted. Acceptance then creates the
**entity** for a mention nobody has ruled on, and opens its membership at the
current revision (§3.2). So "the draft names an unresolved mention" means it
carries a `mention_id`, and the entity is what acceptance creates.

Two consequences the corpus forced, recorded because they look like sloppiness
and are not:

- **Offsets are populated only when the name is verifiably a contiguous span.**
  The real text writes `Kasun "Podda" WIJERATNE` where an extractor reports
  `Kasun Wijeratne`. The name is plainly present but is not a span, so the
  mention is created with **NULL offsets** and listed as unverified for the
  reviewer. Locating is case-insensitive exact match only — an offset found by
  fuzzy alignment would assert the source says something at a position where it
  does not.
- **`mention.language` is left NULL** by extraction. There is no language
  detector in P2, and Latin script does not imply English in this corpus —
  romanized Sinhala and Tamil names are Latin too. `script` is decidable and is
  populated; language waits for a detector rather than being guessed. T19's
  transliteration features key off `script`.

The backfill for Phase-1 claims is **heuristic and lossy**: existing rows record
only `record_id`, never the mention that produced them, so T17 matches
`mention.norm_key` within the claim's own record. Where the heuristic is
ambiguous — several mentions of the same `norm_key` in one record, or none —
the claim is left **unanchored** rather than guessed, and is therefore governed
by rule 4's re-adjudication path. The migration reports the counts it anchored,
left unanchored, and found ambiguous.

**Vocabulary enforcement (ADR-013).** Ontology-owned vocabularies — `predicate`,
`entity_type`, `source_type`, grading values, `handling_code` — are plain TEXT.
The actions layer validates them at write time against the ontology version in force
and stamps that version into `ontology_version`; the DB never encodes them. CHECK
constraints above exist only for code-owned invariants (object XOR, no self-claims,
time sanity, fixed relation/status values), which don't change when the ontology does.

### 3.2 Review queue — the typed suggestion envelope (Article VII, ADR-031)

Rewritten by P2 T17c. The Phase-1 queue carried an opaque `payload` plus a
single `result_claim` FK, and acceptance was hardwired to create a claim — so a
draft that was not a claim could be *written* but never *accepted*. The envelope
below makes the kind explicit and makes acceptance dispatch through the action
the kind declares.

```sql
CREATE TABLE review_queue (
  suggestion_id   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  suggestion_kind TEXT NOT NULL          -- closed, code-owned list (ADR-031 §1); NOT ontology
                  CHECK (suggestion_kind IN ('claim_draft','identity_candidate','claim_relation')),
  schema_version  INTEGER NOT NULL,      -- payload schema version for this kind
  payload         JSONB NOT NULL,        -- validated against the kind's schema, which is
                                         -- GENERATED from target_action's parameters
  target_action   TEXT NOT NULL,         -- ontology action acceptance dispatches through
  producer        TEXT NOT NULL,         -- 'structural_pass' | 'semantic_pass' | 'rule:<name>' | ...
  producer_version TEXT NOT NULL,        -- model+prompt hash, rule/pattern version, settings version
  producer_meta   JSONB NOT NULL,        -- explanation: score waterfall, raw_response_ref, chunk
  record_id       TEXT REFERENCES source_record,  -- the input this was derived from (Article I)
  case_id         TEXT REFERENCES case_file,      -- inherits case scoping for row filters
  idempotency_key TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- sha256(derivative hash|producer|producer_version|payload
                                         -- digest) — a replay updates nothing already decided
  supersedes      TEXT REFERENCES review_queue,   -- re-extraction supersedes, never duplicates
  expires_at      TIMESTAMPTZ,           -- stale machine output ages out of the inbox
  status          TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'suggested'
                  CHECK (status IN ('suggested','accepted','rejected','superseded','expired')),
  decided_by      TEXT,                  -- human actor (Article VII)
  decided_at      TIMESTAMPTZ,
  decision_note   TEXT,
  -- typed result reference: exactly one is set on acceptance, per kind
  result_claim_id    TEXT REFERENCES claim,
  result_decision_id TEXT REFERENCES identity_decision,
  result_relation    JSONB,              -- (from_claim, to_claim, relation) for claim_relation
  created_at      TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  CHECK (status <> 'accepted' OR num_nonnulls(result_claim_id, result_decision_id,
                                              result_relation) = 1)
);
```

**Kind → action → result.** The list is closed and owned by code, not the
ontology — adding a kind is a schema + mapping change, never a queue migration.

| `suggestion_kind` | `target_action` | Result reference | Producers in P2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claim_draft` | `record_claim` | `result_claim_id` | `structural_pass`, `semantic_pass`, `split-readjudication` (§3.1 rule 4) |
| `identity_candidate` | `adjudicate_identity` | `result_decision_id` | promoted from `er_candidate` |
| `claim_relation` | `link_claims` | `result_relation` | analyst |

**Entity creation folds into `claim_draft`** — there is no `entity_draft` kind.
A draft's `subject_ref`/`object_ref` may name an unresolved mention instead of
an `entity_id`; on acceptance `record_claim` creates the mention and entity and
then the claim, in one transaction. This replaces the Phase-1
`producer_meta.draft_kind = "entity"` rows, which no code path could accept
(they raise on the claim-creation path today). It also keeps the ledger honest:
a newly created entity is a single-mention entity at the current revision, not
an adjudicated merge.

**Acceptance never writes tables itself (ADR-031 §2).** The reviewer's decision
calls `target_action` with the reviewer as actor; the action validates against
the ontology, writes, and audits in its own transaction. This is what makes
Article VII's test — "the only writer to canonical tables is a human-executed
action" — mechanically checkable per kind rather than by inspection. Edits made
during review are applied to the payload *before* dispatch, and the edited
payload is stored, so the accepted content is exactly what was reviewed.

**ER candidates are not queue rows.** `er_candidate` (§2) keeps its own table:
high volume, its own lifecycle, its own disposition vocabulary. An
`identity_candidate` queue row is created only when a candidate is promoted for
adjudication. The review **inbox** is a UI composition over `review_queue` and
`er_candidate` (ADR-031 §3) — not one mega-table, and not a view that would
force the two lifecycles to agree.

**Migration of live Phase-1 rows.** Existing rows carry
`producer_meta.draft_kind` ∈ {`claim`, `entity`}:

- `draft_kind='claim'` → `suggestion_kind='claim_draft'`,
  `target_action='record_claim'`, `schema_version=1`; `result_claim` copies to
  `result_claim_id`.
- `draft_kind='entity'` → also `claim_draft`, with the entity draft rewritten
  into the `subject_ref` of the claim it was extracted for. Where no such claim
  exists in the same record, the row is set `status='expired'` with a decision
  note naming this migration — these rows were never acceptable, and silently
  deleting them would violate Article VIII.
- `producer_version` backfills from `producer_meta` where present, else the
  literal `'phase1-unversioned'`; `idempotency_key` backfills from the row's own
  digest. Already-decided rows keep their status, actor, and note untouched.

## 5. Audit (Article X)

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id          BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  at          TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  actor       TEXT NOT NULL,          -- user id or 'system:<job>'
  session_id  TEXT,
  purpose     TEXT,
  case_id     TEXT,
  action      TEXT NOT NULL,          -- 'record_claim', 'read:claims', 'export', 'authz.deny', ...
  resource_type TEXT,
  resource_id TEXT,
  decision    TEXT NOT NULL,          -- allow | deny
  detail      JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',
  prev_hash   TEXT NOT NULL,
  entry_hash  TEXT NOT NULL           -- sha256(prev_hash || canonical_json(all fields above))
);
-- App DB role: INSERT + SELECT only. No UPDATE/DELETE grant exists for anyone but a
-- dedicated maintenance role that ordinary admins do not hold.
```

Chaining is **synchronous**: the audit insert happens inside the action's transaction,
so concurrent audited actions serialize on the chain head. That is deliberate — an
asynchronously-hashed row is an unhashed tamper window. Rationale, capacity math, and
the escape hatch (batching, then per-shard chains + Merkle anchors) are in ADR-015.

## 6. Legacy migration mapping

| Legacy (`pipeline/models.py`) | Target |
|---|---|
| `CriminalNode` | `entity(entity_type=person\|organization)`; `name` → label + `has_name` claim; each alias → `known_as` claim; each affiliation → `affiliated_with` claim (object resolved to org entity when it exists, else literal) |
| `node_id` slug | `mention.norm_key`; one mention + one identity_membership per legacy node (`decided_by='rule:legacy-slug'`) |
| `TemporalEdge.relation` | `claim.predicate` via the verb-remap table in `aegis/migration/legacy.py` (below, ADR-016); migration fails on verbs missing from the table — forcing the table to be complete |
| `layer` | derived — `predicate.category` normally equals the legacy layer (migration asserts); where the ontology deliberately corrects a legacy miscategorization (e.g. `sibling_of`: FIN → `kinship`), the ontology wins and the remap is logged in the migration report |
| `confidence` tag | ConfidenceTag map in `aegis/migration/legacy.py`: `EXTRACTED → confirmed/record_confirmed`, `INFERRED → probably_true/partially_corroborated`, `AMBIGUOUS → doubtful/unverified` — targets validated against the ontology registry at run time (ADR-011, ADR-016) |
| `weight` | not stored — recomputed in projections from normalized grading |
| `start_date`/`end_date` | `valid_from` / `valid_to` |
| `source_file`/`source_excerpt` | `source` + `source_record` (one per SOURCES entry) + `claim.excerpt` |
| `extraction_method` | `collection_method` (`CURATED→curated`, `STRUCTURAL→structural`, `SEMANTIC→semantic_llm`) |
| `SEMANTIC`-produced edges | **not** migrated as recorded claims — re-run passes into `review_queue` (Article VII); only curated + structural edges migrate directly |

Verb-remap table (ADR-016 — legacy narrative verbs normalize into reusable
vocabulary; specifics move onto the claim):

| Legacy verb | Target claim(s) |
|---|---|
| `co_conspirator_in_plot_with` | `conspired_with` |
| `co_masterminded_attacks_with` | `masterminded_attack_with` |
| `suspected_successor_leader_of` | `successor_leader_of`, credibility capped at `possibly_true` |
| `suspected_foreign_is_contact_of` | `foreign_contact_of`, credibility capped at `possibly_true` |
| `sibling_co_attacker_of` | two claims: `sibling_of` + `co_attacker_with` |
| `spousal_co_attacker_of` | two claims: `spouse_of` + `co_attacker_with` |
| `former_ally_turned_rival_of` | two claims: `allied_with` (`valid_to` = edge start) + `rival_of` (`valid_from` = edge start) |
| `avenging_rival_of` | `rival_of` (revenge motive stays in the excerpt) |
| `helped_establish_in_dubai` | `helped_establish_operations_of`, `location_text = 'Dubai'` |
| `ran_narcotics_from_tamil_nadu_with` | `trafficked_narcotics_with`, `location_text = 'Tamil Nadu route'` |
| all other verbs | the same-named ontology predicate |

"Capped at" = the mapped credibility or `possibly_true`, whichever is weaker — a
"suspected" prefix in a verb is grading information, not vocabulary (Article III).

Projection weight function (keeps UI/clustering behavior):
`confirmed→1.0, probably_true→0.7, possibly_true→0.55, doubtful→0.4, improbable→0.2,
cannot_judge→0.4`. Committed as code with tests; tune only with an ADR.
**Legacy-only from P2 (ADR-030):** the v2 projection stores no aggregate weight,
so this function survives solely inside the legacy graph emitter until T22
deletes it. It is a migration-compatibility artifact, not a claim about
confidence.

## 7. Traversal projection v2 (ADR-002, ADR-029, ADR-030)

Rewritten by P2 T17b; implemented by T21. The Phase-1 view (migration `0006`,
still live until T21) fabricates time by collapsing disjoint intervals with
`min`/`max`, erases contradictions with `max(projection_weight(...))`, and
labels distinct records `independent_records`. Together those three produce
precisely the "authoritative rumor engine" GOAL.md forbids. The v2 semantics:

**Identity resolution.** Subject and object resolve through the **active**
identity revision before grouping, so a merge collapses two nodes into one and
a split restores them — with zero claim-row rewrites (ADR-029 §3, specs/05 §5).

Resolution has two paths, and T21 established that the order between them is
load-bearing. An argument carrying a **mention anchor** resolves through that
mention's active membership: adjudication moves memberships, so the claim
follows the mention through both merges *and* splits. An **unanchored**
argument can only resolve through `entity_canonical_map`, which follows merges
but cannot follow a split, because nothing records which side it belonged to —
so those claims stay with the surviving entity and are queued for
re-adjudication (§3.1 rule 4) rather than guessed at. The build reports the
ratio of anchor-resolved to map-resolved endpoints, which is a live measure of
how reversible the graph actually is.

**Symmetric predicates are re-normalized after resolution.** Symmetric
arguments are ordered at write time, but resolution happens later and can
reverse a pair: after a merge, `A allied_with C` and `C allied_with B(→A)`
describe one undirected edge while pointing opposite ways. The builder
re-normalizes the pair post-resolution, or the merge silently fails to collapse
and the graph keeps two mirror-image edges (found by the T21 blocking tests).

**Time — interval sets, never collapsed.** An edge is emitted as
**time-segmented rows**: one row per maximal interval over which the same
supporting claim set holds. Two claims covering 2019 and 2023 produce two
segments, not one 2019–2023 edge. An open interval (`valid_to IS NULL`) stays
open in its own segment.

**Confidence — no authoritative scalar.** No aggregate weight column exists.
The edge carries a **support summary**: the grading references of every
supporting claim (reliability, credibility, verification kept separate —
Article III), a contradiction count and a corroboration count from
`claim_relation`, and the aggregation method + version that produced it. Any
display score is computed in the UI from the summary and is inspectable
(Article III's "display scores are *derived*"). The Phase-1
`projection_weight()` function survives only inside the legacy emitter until
T22 deletes it.

**Counting — `record_count`, never "independent".** Distinct supporting records
are counted and named `record_count`. Independence is a claim about source
derivation that Aegis cannot yet substantiate; until a source-derivation model
exists, **no independence is rendered anywhere** (ADR-030 §3).

**Stamps.** Every build records the identity revision, ontology version, and
builder version it ran at, so any rendered edge is fully attributable and a
stale projection is detectable rather than silently wrong.

```sql
-- Implemented by T21 in migration 0008; `aegis.projections.edges` owns the
-- build. A TABLE, not a matview: segmentation is not a single GROUP BY.
-- `edge_id` is a content digest of (subject, object, predicate, segment
-- bounds), so a segment keeps its id across rebuilds and two builds are
-- diffable; the stamps, not the id, mark a row fresh or stale. A partial
-- UNIQUE ... NULLS NOT DISTINCT index over (subject, object, predicate,
-- segment_from) enforces "one row per maximal interval" in the database
-- rather than by convention.
CREATE TABLE edge_projection (
  edge_id        TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  subject_id     TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES entity,   -- canonical at build revision
  object_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES entity,
  predicate      TEXT NOT NULL,
  segment_from   DATE,                              -- one row per maximal interval
  segment_to     DATE,                              -- NULL = open
  claim_ids      TEXT[] NOT NULL,                   -- the claims holding over this segment
  record_count   INTEGER NOT NULL,                  -- DISTINCT records — never "independent"
  support        JSONB NOT NULL,                    -- per-claim grading refs, contradiction +
                                                    -- corroboration counts, method + version
  handling_rank  INTEGER NOT NULL,                  -- max over supporting claims (row filter)
  built_at_revision_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES identity_revision,
  ontology_version TEXT NOT NULL,
  builder_version  TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

k-hop expansion = recursive CTE over this table with hop limit, handling-rank filter,
and time predicates pushed into the segment bounds. The graph-JSON emitter and Cypher
export read it. Losing the whole table loses nothing (Article XIII).

### 7.1 Blocking tests (ADR-029 §5, ADR-030)

All green in `tests/integration/test_edge_projection.py` (T21), with the
interval algebra itself covered in `tests/unit/test_edge_segmentation.py`.

| Case | Assertion |
|---|---|
| Merge collapse | Merging B into A collapses their nodes and edges; **no claim row is modified** |
| Split restore | Splitting B back out restores the pre-merge edge set exactly, again with zero claim rewrites |
| Disjoint intervals | Claims covering 2019 and 2023 yield **two segments**, not one continuous edge |
| Contradiction survives | An edge supported by contradicting claims exposes both in its support summary; no aggregate hides either |
| Attribution | Every rendered edge resolves to ≥ 1 source record (Article I) |
| Stamp freshness | An edge built at an older revision is detectable as stale via `built_at_revision_id` |
| Unanchored on split | An ambiguous unanchored claim appears in the review inbox rather than being reassigned (§3.1 rule 4) |

T21 added four cases the plan did not anticipate, each covering a way the
projection could fabricate or lose an edge: **adjacency** (a claim ending
2019-12-31 and one starting 2020-01-01 must not leave a phantom uncovered day
— the segmenter is half-open internally for this reason), **both-endpoint
merge** (if A and B turn out to be one person, "A allied with B" leaves the
graph rather than becoming a self-loop), **retraction** (soft in the store,
total in the cache), and **id-stable idempotency** (rebuilding twice yields
identical rows *and* identical ids).

## 8. Indexing (Phase 1 minimum)

- `claim(subject_id)`, `claim(object_id)`, `claim(predicate)`, `claim(record_id)`,
  partial index `WHERE retracted_at IS NULL`.
- `mention(norm_key)`, `entity(label gin_trgm_ops)` for lookup.
- P2 additions: `claim(subject_mention_id)`, `claim(object_mention_id)` (split
  re-adjudication looks claims up by mention); `identity_membership(entity_id)
  WHERE closed_revision_id IS NULL` (canonical-map rebuild and scoped
  concurrency checks); `er_candidate(disposition) WHERE disposition = 'open'`
  (inbox scan); `edge_projection(subject_id, predicate)` and
  `(object_id, predicate)` for k-hop expansion.
- `source_record(ingest_key)` unique (exists), `(content_hash)`.
- `audit_log(at)`, `audit_log(actor, at)`.
- `authz_outbox(processed_at) WHERE processed_at IS NULL` (dispatcher scan, ADR-014).
