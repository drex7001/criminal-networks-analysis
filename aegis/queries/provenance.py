"""Why is this edge here? (T21; GOAL.md §18, specs/06 §2.1)

The question the platform exists to answer.  A graph that shows a line between
two people without being able to say *why* is an accusation with no evidence
behind it — so every rendered edge must open onto the claims, the sources, the
gradings, the disagreements, and the identity decisions that produced it.

Three rules shape what these functions return:

**Nothing is summarized into a verdict.**  Reliability, credibility and
verification come back separately (Article III), and corroboration sits beside
contradiction rather than being netted against it (Article VIII).  The caller
renders; this layer reports.

**Authorization is applied in the query, not after it.**  Claims a caller may
not read never enter the result, so the counts and the identity line are
computed over exactly what that caller can see.  A provenance panel that leaked
"there are 3 more claims you cannot see" would leak the claims' existence.

**Identity is part of the provenance.**  An edge can exist because two mentions
were adjudicated to be one person; if so, the decision that did it — who, when,
and on what note — belongs in the answer as much as any source record does.
