"""Deterministic ER rules → **candidates**, never merges (T18; spec 05 §3.1).

Nothing in this module changes identity.  Every rule writes an
:class:`~aegis.store.ErCandidate` row and stops; a membership only moves when a
human executes ``adjudicate_identity`` (ADR-027, Article VII).  The value a
deterministic rule adds is *rank*, not authority: an exact registry-identifier
match is pre-verified, so a reviewer can confirm a batch of them in one action
instead of one at a time — but it is still the reviewer who decides.

Two rule families, and the gap between them is the point:

* **Identifier match** — two mentions whose entities carry the same registry
  identifier.  Pre-verified.  The engine names no identifier itself: it asks
  the ontology which predicates are declared ``identifier: true``, so a new
  domain adds identifiers by declaring them (Article XIV).
* **Same ``norm_key`` inside one document** — ranked above cross-document noise
  and **never** pre-verified.  One document listing a name twice is weak
  evidence: documents do list different people who share a common name.

Cross-document name similarity is deliberately absent.  It is Splink's job
(T19), where it arrives with a score and a per-feature waterfall instead of a
bare assertion that two slugs matched.
