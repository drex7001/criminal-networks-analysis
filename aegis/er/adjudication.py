"""Ledger mechanics for `adjudicate_identity` (T20; spec 05 §4, ADR-028).

The four modes — confirm, reject, split, unresolved — are the *only* writers to
`identity_decision`, `identity_revision` and `identity_membership` after the
migration baseline.  Each is one transaction: decision + revision + membership
changes + audit, with the scoped concurrency check of spec 05 §2.

Transaction and audit belong to :class:`~aegis.actions.ActionService`; this

    entity that was absorbed, not the survivor being split now.  Matching the
