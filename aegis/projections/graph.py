"""Legacy graph-JSON projection (speckit T10, plan §4.4, ADR-002).

Rebuilds ``output/real_graph.json`` — the exact schema the current UI and the
Cypher exporter consume — from the canonical claim store:

* nodes come from entities, their mention (slug + note + backing source), and
  their node-property claims (``known_as`` → aliases, ``affiliated_with`` →
  affiliations);
* edges come from the ``edge_projection`` materialized view, detail fields
  from the strongest claim in each group;
* cells come from the unchanged prototype clustering
  (:func:`legacy.pipeline.clustering.detect_cells`) running on the projection.

Everything here is derived state (Article XIII): safe to delete and rebuild.
