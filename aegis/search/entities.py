"""Entity search over names, aliases and mention keys (spec 06 §2.1, T23c).

**Authorization is applied in candidate generation, not in hydration**
(ADR-012, B-17). That is the whole shape of this module: an entity carries no
handling code of its own — claims do — so an entity is reachable here only
through a claim the caller may read. Generating candidates first and filtering
afterwards would answer "no results" and "results you may not see" with
different response *sizes*, which is the inference channel spec 06 §6 closes
everywhere else.

Cross-script matching reads the stored ``latin_key``/``phonetic_key``
(ADR-035). ``norm_key`` preserves non-Latin script deliberately, so it can
match a romanization to a romanization and never a Latin query to a Sinhala
name; the stored keys are what can.
