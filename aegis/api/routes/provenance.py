"""Provenance routes — "why connected?" (T21; GOAL.md §18, specs/06 §2.1).

These are read routes over the claim store, not over the projection: the
projection is a cache that answers *what* is connected, and this answers *why*,
which must come from canonical claims (Article XIII — the cache is never the
authority for evidence).

Authorization conditions are passed into the query so filtered claims never
enter the result set. Counts and the identity line are therefore computed over
exactly what this caller may see — a panel reporting evidence it then refuses
to show would leak the existence of the claims behind it (specs/03 §4).
