"""Temporal multiplex graph extraction pipeline for legal/intelligence documents.

Dual-pass architecture (mirrors Graphify):
  - structural_pass: deterministic regex parsing of structured lists (free, EXTRACTED only)
  - semantic_pass:   LLM extraction of narrative text (provider-agnostic via LangChain)

Every edge carries a Graphify-style confidence tag (EXTRACTED / INFERRED / AMBIGUOUS),
a derived weight (1.0 / 0.7 / 0.4), a multiplex layer, and a temporal window.
