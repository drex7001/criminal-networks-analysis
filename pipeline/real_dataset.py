"""Curated REAL-world dataset: Sri Lankan illicit-network graph from public reporting.

This is the deterministic OSINT layer of the real pipeline. Every node and edge is
compiled from publicly reported information (Wikipedia, court/PCoI reporting, and named
Sri Lankan news outlets) and carries a source citation plus an honest confidence tag:

    EXTRACTED  (1.0)  fact stated plainly in an official record or by named reporting
    INFERRED   (0.7)  probable link that reporting supports but has not adjudicated
    AMBIGUOUS  (0.4)  alleged / contested / uncorroborated (e.g. IS "direction")

IMPORTANT — read before using:
  * This is an ANALYTICAL model built ONLY from open, public reporting. It is not a
    determination of guilt and asserts nothing beyond what the cited sources say.
  * Confidence tags encode source strength. AMBIGUOUS edges are explicitly contested.
  * Most individuals here are deceased, convicted, or charged in matters of extensive
    public record (a terrorist attack investigated by a Presidential Commission, and
    narcotics cases reported nationally). National ID numbers are deliberately omitted.
  * The three documented networks (historical Colombo underworld, modern transnational
    narcotics, 2019 Easter/NTJ extremism) are NOT linked to each other in the public
    record. The graph keeps them separate on purpose; community detection recovering
    them as distinct cells is itself the analytical finding.

The dataset is expressed through the same Pydantic models as every other pass, so it is
validated identically (weights derived from tags, temporal windows checked, IDs slugged).
