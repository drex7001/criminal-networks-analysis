/**
 * Path-based view selection, on the History API directly.
 *
 * P2 has two views, and a router library is not what two views need. What they
 * do need is real URLs — the back button, a deep link to `/sources`, and a path
 * the auth guard can hand to `returnTo` — which is all this provides.
 *
 * The reason it is here rather than `react-router` is narrower than "fewer
 * dependencies": the OIDC callback finishes by rewriting the URL with
 * `history.replaceState` (auth/config.ts), and a router that owns the history
 * stack would not observe that write. Swapping in a router therefore means
 * re-testing the sign-in round trip, and it is worth doing once, in P4, when
 * the view count actually justifies it — not now, for two.

 * the page the user originally asked for, *after* the app has already mounted
 * at `/auth/callback`. Without the notification the app renders the fallback
 * view at the right URL — which is what happened, and what the sources journey
